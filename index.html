                                Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for
                                any liability<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; END

                                Inc.,<br><br> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br><br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br><br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
                                licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br><br>freedom to share and change it.&nbsp;By contrast, the GNU General Public<br><br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br><br>software--to
                                make sure the software is free for all its users.&nbsp;This<br><br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br><br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br><br>using it.&nbsp;(Some
                                other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br><br>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)&nbsp;You can apply it to<br><br>your programs, too.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are
                                referring to freedom, not<br><br>price.&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br><br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br><br>this service if you wish),
                                that you receive source code or can get it<br><br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br><br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To protect
                                your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br><br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br><br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br><br>distribute
                                copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br><br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br><br>you
                                have.&nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br><br>source code.&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they know their<br><br>rights.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;We protect your rights with two steps:
                                (1) copyright the software, and<br><br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br><br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Also, for each author's protection and ours,
                                we want to make certain<br><br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br><br>software.&nbsp;If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br><br>want its recipients to know that
                                what they have is not the original, so<br><br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br><br>authors' reputations.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
                                by software<br><br>patents.&nbsp;We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br><br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br><br>program proprietary.&nbsp;To prevent this,
                                we have made it clear that any<br><br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br><br>modification follow.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU
                                GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br><br>&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br><br>a notice placed by the
                                copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br><br>under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp;The "Program", below,<br><br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br><br>means either
                                the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br><br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br><br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br><br>language.&nbsp;(Hereinafter,
                                translation is included without limitation in<br><br>the term "modification".)&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br><br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br><br>covered
                                by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp;The act of<br><br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br><br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br><br>Program
                                (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br><br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br><br>source
                                code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br><br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br><br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br><br>notices
                                that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br><br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br><br>along with the Program.<br><br><br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical
                                act of transferring a copy, and<br><br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br><br>of it, thus
                                forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br><br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br><br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a)
                                You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or
                                publish, that in<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;parties under the
                                terms of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;interactive
                                use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a
                                warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;License.&nbsp;(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
                                but<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br><br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work
                                as a whole.&nbsp;If<br><br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br><br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br><br>themselves, then this License, and its terms,
                                do not apply to those<br><br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp;But when you<br><br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br><br>on the Program, the distribution of
                                the whole must be on the terms of<br><br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br><br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br><br><br>Thus, it is not
                                the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br><br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br><br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br><br>collective
                                works based on the Program.<br><br><br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br><br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br><br>a storage or distribution
                                medium does not bring the other work under<br><br>the scope of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br><br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                                under the terms of<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;source code,
                                which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for
                                at least three<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-readable copy
                                of the corresponding source code, to be<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c)
                                Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp;(This alternative is<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only
                                if you<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;received the program in object code or executable form with such<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br><br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form
                                of the work for<br><br>making modifications to it.&nbsp;For an executable work, complete source<br><br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br><br>associated interface definition files, plus
                                the scripts used to<br><br>control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp;However, as a<br><br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br><br>anything that is normally distributed (in
                                either source or binary<br><br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br><br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br><br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br><br><br>If
                                distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br><br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br><br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br><br>distribution
                                of the source code, even though third parties are not<br><br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br><br>except
                                as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp;Any attempt<br><br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br><br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br><br>However,
                                parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br><br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br><br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;5. You are not required
                                to accept this License, since you have not<br><br>signed it.&nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br><br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp;These actions are<br><br>prohibited
                                by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp;Therefore, by<br><br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br><br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br><br>all
                                its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br><br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br><br>Program), the recipient
                                automatically receives a license from the<br><br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br><br>these terms and conditions.&nbsp;You may not impose any further<br><br>restrictions on the recipients'
                                exercise of the rights granted herein.<br><br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br><br>this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br><br>infringement
                                or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br><br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br><br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br><br>excuse
                                you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;If you cannot<br><br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br><br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br><br>may
                                not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp;For example, if a patent<br><br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br><br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br><br>the
                                only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br><br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br><br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br><br>any particular
                                circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br><br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br><br>circumstances.<br><br><br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
                                any<br><br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br><br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br><br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br><br>implemented
                                by public license practices.&nbsp;Many people have made<br><br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br><br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br><br>system; it
                                is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br><br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br><br>impose that choice.<br><br><br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly
                                clear what is believed to<br><br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br><br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
                                interfaces, the<br><br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br><br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br><br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted
                                only in or among<br><br>countries not thus excluded.&nbsp;In such case, this License incorporates<br><br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;9. The Free Software Foundation may
                                publish revised and/or new versions<br><br>of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp;Such new versions will<br><br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br><br>address new
                                problems or concerns.<br><br><br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;If the Program<br><br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br><br>later version", you have
                                the option of following the terms and conditions<br><br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br><br>Software Foundation.&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of<br><br>this
                                License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br><br>Foundation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br><br>programs whose distribution conditions
                                are different, write to the author<br><br>to ask for permission.&nbsp;For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br><br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br><br>make exceptions
                                for this.&nbsp;Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br><br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br><br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO
                                WARRANTY<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br><br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN<br><br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
                                THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br><br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br><br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br><br>MERCHANTABILITY
                                AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br><br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;SHOULD THE<br><br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br><br>REPAIR
                                OR CORRECTION.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br><br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br><br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
                                PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br><br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br><br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br><br>TO
                                LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br><br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br><br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
                                OF THE<br><br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms
                                to Your New Programs<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br><br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br><br>free software which everyone
                                can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;It is safest<br><br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br><br>convey
                                the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br><br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &nbsp;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This
                                program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of

                                <br><br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br><br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
                                GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br><br>software and other kinds of works.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br><br>to take away your freedom
                                to share and change the works.&nbsp;By contrast,<br><br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br><br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br><br>software
                                for all its users.&nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br><br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br><br>any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp;You can apply
                                it to<br><br>your programs, too.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br><br>price.&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br><br>have the freedom
                                to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br><br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br><br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br><br>free programs,
                                and that you know you can do these things.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br><br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;Therefore, you have<br><br>certain
                                responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br><br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br><br>gratis
                                or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br><br>freedoms that you received.&nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive<br><br>or can get the source code.&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so
                                they<br><br>know their rights.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br><br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br><br>giving you legal
                                permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br><br>that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp;For both users' and<br><br>authors'
                                sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br><br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br><br>authors of previous versions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Some devices are designed
                                to deny users access to install or run<br><br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br><br>can do so.&nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br><br>protecting users' freedom
                                to change the software.&nbsp;The systematic<br><br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br><br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;Therefore, we<br><br>have designed
                                this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br><br>products.&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br><br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br><br>of
                                the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br><br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br><br>software
                                on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br><br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br><br>make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br><br>patents
                                cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br><br>modification follow.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;0. Definitions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply
                                to other kinds of<br><br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br><br>License.&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp;"Licensees"
                                and<br><br>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br><br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
                                making of an<br><br>exact copy.&nbsp;The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br><br>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "covered work" means either the unmodified
                                Program or a work based<br><br>on the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br><br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br><br>infringement
                                under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br><br>computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp;Propagation includes copying,<br><br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br><br>public,
                                and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br><br>parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through<br><br>a
                                computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br><br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently
                                visible<br><br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br><br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br><br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
                                convey the<br><br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp;If<br><br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br><br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
                                criterion.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;1. Source Code.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br><br>for making modifications to it.&nbsp;"Object code" means any non-source<br><br>form
                                of a work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br><br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br><br>interfaces specified for a particular
                                programming language, one that<br><br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br><br>than the work as a whole,
                                that (a) is included in the normal form of<br><br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br><br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br><br>Major Component, or to
                                implement a Standard Interface for which an<br><br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp;A<br><br>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br><br>(kernel, window
                                system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br><br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br><br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
                                "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br><br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br><br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br><br>control
                                those activities.&nbsp;However, it does not include the work's<br><br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br><br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br><br>which
                                are not part of the work.&nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source<br><br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br><br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br><br>linked
                                subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br><br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br><br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Corresponding
                                Source need not include anything that users<br><br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br><br>Source.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br><br>same
                                work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br><br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br><br>conditions
                                are met.&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br><br>permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;The output from running a<br><br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br><br>content,
                                constitutes a covered work.&nbsp;This License acknowledges your<br><br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do
                                not<br><br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br><br>in force.&nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br><br>of having them make modifications exclusively for
                                you, or provide you<br><br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br><br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br><br>not control copyright.&nbsp;Those thus
                                making or running the covered works<br><br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br><br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br><br>your copyrighted material outside
                                their relationship with you.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br><br>the conditions stated below.&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br><br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;3.
                                Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br><br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br><br>11
                                of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br><br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br><br>measures.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal
                                power to forbid<br><br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br><br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br><br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
                                to limit operation or<br><br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br><br>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br><br>technological measures.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;4.
                                Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br><br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br><br>appropriately publish on each
                                copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br><br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br><br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br><br>keep intact all notices of the
                                absence of any warranty; and give all<br><br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br><br>and you may offer support
                                or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br><br>produce it from the Program,
                                in the form of source code under the<br><br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it,
                                and giving a relevant date.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;released under this License and any conditions added under section<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;This
                                requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"keep intact all notices".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;License to anyone
                                who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;This<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless
                                of how they are packaged.&nbsp;This License gives no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d)
                                If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,
                                your<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not make them do so.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br><br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br><br>and
                                which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br><br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br><br>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br><br>used
                                to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br><br>beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work<br><br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br><br>parts
                                of the aggregate.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br><br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br><br>machine-readable
                                Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br><br>in one of these ways:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution
                                medium), accompanied by the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Convey the object code in,
                                or embodied in, a physical product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;long
                                as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
                                in the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost
                                of physically performing this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual
                                copies of the object code with a copy of the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp;This<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;only
                                if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis
                                or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;further charge.&nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding
                                Source along with the object code.&nbsp;If the place to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;that
                                supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source.&nbsp;Regardless of what server
                                hosts the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Convey the object
                                code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;charge
                                under subsection 6d.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br><br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br><br>included in conveying the object
                                code work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br><br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br><br>or household purposes, or (2) anything
                                designed or sold for incorporation<br><br>into a dwelling.&nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br><br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;For a particular<br><br>product
                                received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br><br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br><br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br><br>actually
                                uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp;A product<br><br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br><br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br><br>the
                                only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br><br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br><br>and
                                execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br><br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp;The information must<br><br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
                                object<br><br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br><br>modification has been made.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br><br>specifically
                                for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br><br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br><br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br><br>fixed
                                term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br><br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br><br>by the Installation Information.&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply<br><br>if
                                neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br><br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br><br>been installed in ROM).<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation
                                Information does not include a<br><br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br><br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br><br>the User Product in which
                                it has been modified or installed.&nbsp;Access to a<br><br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br><br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br><br>protocols
                                for communication across the network.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br><br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br><br>documented
                                (and with an implementation available to the public in<br><br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br><br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;7. Additional Terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"Additional
                                permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br><br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br><br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br><br>be treated
                                as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br><br>that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;If additional permissions<br><br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br><br>under
                                those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br><br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br><br>remove
                                any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br><br>it.&nbsp;(Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br><br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp;You may place<br><br>additional
                                permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br><br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br><br>add
                                to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br><br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
                                from the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;author attributions in that material
                                or in the Appropriate Legal<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;requiring that
                                modified versions of such material be marked in<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;authors
                                of the material; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Requiring indemnification
                                of licensors and authors of that<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;any
                                liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;those licensors and authors.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br><br>restrictions"
                                within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;If the Program as you<br><br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br><br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br><br>restriction,
                                you may remove that term.&nbsp;If a license document contains<br><br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br><br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br><br>of
                                that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br><br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br><br>must place,
                                in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br><br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br><br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Additional terms, permissive or
                                non-permissive, may be stated in the<br><br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br><br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;8. Termination.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may
                                not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br><br>provided under this License.&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br><br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br><br>this
                                License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br><br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br><br>license from a particular copyright
                                holder is reinstated (a)<br><br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br><br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br><br>holder fails to notify you of the
                                violation by some reasonable means<br><br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br><br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies
                                you of the<br><br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br><br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br><br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior
                                to 30 days after<br><br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br><br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br><br>this
                                License.&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br><br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br><br>material under section 10.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required
                                for Having Copies.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br><br>run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br><br>occurring solely as a consequence
                                of using peer-to-peer transmission<br><br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;However,<br><br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br><br>modify any covered work.&nbsp;These
                                actions infringe copyright if you do<br><br>not accept this License.&nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br><br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;10. Automatic
                                Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br><br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br><br>propagate that work,
                                subject to this License.&nbsp;You are not responsible<br><br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br><br>organization,
                                or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br><br>organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp;If propagation of a covered<br><br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br><br>transaction
                                who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br><br>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br><br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br><br>Corresponding
                                Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br><br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br><br>rights
                                granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;For example, you may<br><br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br><br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br><br>(including
                                a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br><br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br><br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;11.
                                Patents.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br><br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp;The<br><br>work thus licensed is called the contributor's
                                "contributor version".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br><br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br><br>hereafter acquired, that would
                                be infringed by some manner, permitted<br><br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br><br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br><br>consequence of further modification
                                of the contributor version.&nbsp;For<br><br>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br><br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br><br>this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each
                                contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br><br>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br><br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br><br>propagate
                                the contents of its contributor version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br><br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br><br>(such
                                as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br><br>sue for patent infringement).&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br><br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce
                                a<br><br>patent against the party.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br><br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br><br>to copy, free
                                of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br><br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br><br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br><br>available,
                                or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br><br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br><br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br><br>license
                                to downstream recipients.&nbsp;"Knowingly relying" means you have<br><br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br><br>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br><br>in
                                a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br><br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br><br>arrangement,
                                you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br><br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br><br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br><br>or convey
                                a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br><br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br><br>work and works based on it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A patent license is "discriminatory"
                                if it does not include within<br><br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br><br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br><br>specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;You
                                may not convey a covered<br><br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br><br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br><br>to the third party based on the extent
                                of your activity of conveying<br><br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br><br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br><br>patent license (a) in connection with
                                copies of the covered work<br><br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br><br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br><br>contain the covered work, unless you
                                entered into that arrangement,<br><br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br><br>any implied license or other
                                defenses to infringement that may<br><br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If conditions are imposed on you (whether
                                by court order, agreement or<br><br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br><br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br><br>covered work so as to
                                satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br><br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br><br>not convey it at all.&nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br><br>to
                                collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br><br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br><br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;13.
                                Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br><br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br><br>under
                                version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br><br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp;The terms of this<br><br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br><br>but
                                the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br><br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br><br>combination as such.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;14. Revised Versions of this
                                License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br><br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp;Such new versions will<br><br>be similar in spirit to the
                                present version, but may differ in detail to<br><br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;If the<br><br>Program specifies that a certain numbered
                                version of the GNU General<br><br>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br><br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br><br>version or of any later version published
                                by the Free Software<br><br>Foundation.&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br><br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br><br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If
                                the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br><br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br><br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br><br>to
                                choose that version for the Program.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Later license versions may give you additional or different<br><br>permissions.&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br><br>author or copyright
                                holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br><br>later version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br><br>APPLICABLE
                                LAW.&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br><br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br><br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

                                use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br><br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;It
                                is safest<br><br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br><br>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br><br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
                                notice is found.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &nbsp;<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;it under the terms

                                program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;See
                                the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;along with this program.&nbsp;If not, see
                                .<br><br><br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br><br>notice like this when it starts in an
                                interactive mode:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is free software, and you are
                                welcome to redistribute it<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br><br><br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br><br>parts of the General Public
                                License.&nbsp;Of course, your program's commands<br><br>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br><br>if
                                any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br><br>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br><br>.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The GNU General Public License does not
                                permit incorporating your program<br><br>into proprietary programs.&nbsp;If your program is a subroutine library, you<br><br>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br><br>the library.&nbsp;If
                                this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br><br>Public License instead of this License.&nbsp;But first, please read<br><br>.<br><br></p>

                                used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br><br>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br><br>General Public License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;"The Library" refers
                                to a covered work governed by this License,<br><br>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br><br>by the Library,
                                but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br><br>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br><br>of using an interface provided by the Library.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;A "Combined Work"
                                is a work produced by combining or linking an<br><br>Application with the Library.&nbsp;The particular version of the Library<br><br>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br><br>Version".<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The
                                "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br><br>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br><br>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br><br>based
                                on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br><br>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br><br>and
                                utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br><br>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You
                                may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br><br>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If you modify a copy of
                                the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br><br>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br><br>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br><br>facility is invoked),
                                then you may convey a copy of the modified<br><br>version:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br><br>&nbsp; ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply
                                the<br><br>&nbsp; function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br><br>&nbsp; whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions
                                of<br><br>&nbsp; this License applicable to that copy.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
                                from<br><br>a header file that is part of the Library.&nbsp;You may convey such object<br><br>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br><br>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data
                                structure<br><br>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br><br>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; a) Give prominent notice with each copy
                                of the object code that the<br><br>&nbsp; Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br><br>&nbsp; covered by this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and
                                this license<br><br>&nbsp; document.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;4. Combined Works.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br><br>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification
                                of the<br><br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br><br>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br><br>the following:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; a) Give prominent
                                notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br><br>&nbsp; the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br><br>&nbsp; covered by this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; b) Accompany the Combined Work with
                                a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br><br>&nbsp; document.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br><br>&nbsp; execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br><br>&nbsp;
                                these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br><br>&nbsp; copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; d) Do one of the following:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0) Convey
                                the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user
                                to<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manner specified
                                by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding Source.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp;A
                                suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
                                version<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br><br>&nbsp;
                                be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br><br>&nbsp; GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br><br>&nbsp; necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br><br>&nbsp;
                                Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br><br>&nbsp; Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br><br>&nbsp; you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br><br>&nbsp;
                                the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br><br>&nbsp; Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br><br>&nbsp; Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br><br>&nbsp;
                                for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;5. Combined Libraries.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br><br>Library side by side in a single library together
                                with other library<br><br>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br><br>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br><br>choice, if you do both of the following:<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;
                                a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br><br>&nbsp; on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br><br>&nbsp; conveyed under the terms of this License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;
                                b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br><br>&nbsp; is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br><br>&nbsp; accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;6.
                                Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br><br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
                                new<br><br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br><br>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br><br>Library
                                as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br><br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br><br>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br><br>conditions
                                either of that published version or of any later version<br><br>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br><br>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br><br>General Public
                                License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br><br>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br><br>whether
                                future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br><br>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br><br>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br><br>Library.<br><br></p>
