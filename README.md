## JoiPlay

JoiPlay is a game launcher for Android. Most of Ren'Py, RPG Maker XP/VX/VX Ace/MV, TyranoBuilder and HTML based games can be played without porting on JoiPlay.

JoiPlay uses plugins based on [Ren'Py](https://github.com/renpy/renpy), [rapt](https://github.com/renpy/rapt), [MKXP](https://github.com/pulsejet/mkxp) and [android-mkxp](https://github.com/pulsejet/android-mkxp) projects.
